First, go to [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Then, click on "New Application" button at the top-right corner of the page.

Enter a name for your application. (this won't be your Bot's name, you can change it whenever you want)

Click the "Bot" button on the left menu.

Click "Add Bot" button and confirm it. You can change account details of your bot there (such as username, profile picture etc.)

Now click the "Copy" button under the "Click to Reveal Token" text and paste it into .env (create if not exists) file like this:

`DISCORD_TOKEN = "PASTE_IT_HERE"`
